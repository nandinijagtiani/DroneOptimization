    "We explain this approximation for a function $f$ of a single variable $x$. The piecewise-linear function is described by a collection of segments $\\mathcal{S}$. In the case where the domain of the function is an unbounded set, or the function is not continuous, the segment approach has proven effective. Each segment $i$ has an $(B_i,f_i)$ coordinate point, a (potentially infinite) length $l_i$, and a slope $m_i$, the rate of increase or decrease of the function from $(B_i,f_i)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The sign of the $l_i$ determines if the segment expands to the left (negative length) or the right (positive length) of the $(B_i,f_i)$ point. These segment definitions allow more than pure piecewise-linear functions.  Segments can overlap, meaning we can have multi-valued functions, and there can be holes in the $x$ coordinate space. There is also no order requirement of the segment $B_i$ coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each segment has two variables associated with it. The first is a binary\n",
    "variable $b_i$ that chooses the segment to be used. In order that we have a single value for the function at $x$, only one segment can be active, which is modeled using:\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{S}} b_i = 1.$$\n",
    "The other segment variable is a nonnegative variable $\\lambda_i$ whose upper bound is the absolute value of the length of the segment: $\\lambda_i \\leq |l_i|$. This variable measures how far we move into segment $i$ from the starting point $(B_i,f_i)$ A particular choice of the vectors $b$ and $\\lambda$ formed from these components determines a point of evaluation $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and the value of the approximation $f$ at $x$ by the following formulae ($\\text{sgn}(l_i)$ denotes the “sign” of the parameter $l_i$):\n",
    "$$x = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{S}}(B_ib_i + \\text{sgn}(l_i)\\lambda_i), f = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{S}}(f_ib_i + \\text{sgn}(l_i)m_i\\lambda_i)$$"

    "If the piecewise-linear function contains segments of infinite length, this constraint does not work.  Instead, for these segments, we form a SOS1 set containing the variables $\\lambda_i$ and $1-b_i$, that is at most one of these two variables is positive. This has the same effect as the $M$ constraint, but is independent of the length of the segment and hence also works with infinite length. (Note: this is not needed in the purchase example)"
