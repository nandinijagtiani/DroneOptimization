### Objective
- A drone delivery route planner that computes energy-efficient, multi-stop delivery paths based on payload weight, battery constraints, and recharge locations. 
- Supports MK27 and MK30 drone models and visualizes routes on a city map of Madison, WI.

### Features
- Optimizes drone routes across 17+ delivery locations using payload and battery data
- Supports dynamic recharge planning and drone model selection (MK27, MK30)
- Visualizes routes and charging stops using Matplotlib, Cartopy, and OpenStreetMap
- Energy usage minimized using Gamspy optimization models
- Front-end (in progress) allows user interaction with custom inputs
